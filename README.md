# CodeAlpha_Hangman_game
This Python script for a Hangman game demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in a structured and engaging manner. 
The code is organized into distinct functions that handle specific tasks, making it clean and manageable. 
It employs sets for efficient data management, which is crucial for checking membership and ensuring unique entries.
The game logic is driven by loops and conditional statements that dictate the gameplay based on user inputs and the game state.
Input validation is incorporated to ensure that user responses are appropriate, highlighting the importance of secure and reliable user interaction in programming. By leveraging basic Python features like loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures, the script effectively creates an interactive game. 
This project not only reinforces programming fundamentals but also illustrates how these elements can be pieced together to build a functional and user-friendly application, making it a valuable learning tool for beginners in programming.
